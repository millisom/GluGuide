# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Purpose
[Specify the purpose of this SRS. The SRS should fully describe the external behavior of the application or subsystem identified. It also describes nonfunctional requirements, design constraints, and other factors necessary to provide a complete and comprehensive description of the requirements for the software.]

## 1.2 Scope
[A brief description of the software application that the SRS applies to; the feature or other subsystem grouping; what Use-Case model(s) it is associated with; and anything else that is affected or influenced by this document.]

## 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
[This subsection should provide the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly interpret the SRS. This information may be provided by reference to the project Glossary.]

## 1.4 References
[This subsection should provide a complete list of all documents referenced elsewhere in the SRS. Each document should be identified by title, report number (if applicable), date, and publishing organization. Specify the sources from which the references can be obtained.]

## 1.5 Overview
[This subsection should describe what the rest of the SRS contains and explain how the document is organized.]

---

# 2. Overall Description
[This section of the SRS should describe the general factors that affect the product and its requirements. This section does not state specific requirements. Instead, it provides a background for those requirements, which are defined in detail in Section 3.]

- Product perspective
- Product functions
- User characteristics
- Constraints
- Assumptions and dependencies
- Requirements subsets

---

# 3. Specific Requirements
[This section of the SRS should contain all the software requirements to a level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those requirements.]

## 3.1 Functionality
[This section describes the functional requirements of the system.]

### 3.1.1 Functional Requirement One
[The requirement description.]

## 3.2 Usability
[This section should include all of those requirements that affect usability.]

### 3.2.1 Usability Requirement One
[The requirement description goes here.]

## 3.3 Reliability
[Requirements for reliability of the system should be specified here.]

- Availability-specify the percentage of time available.
- Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF).
- Mean Time To Repair (MTTR).
- Accuracy-specify precision and accuracy.
- Maximum Bugs or Defect Rate.

### 3.3.1 Reliability Requirement One
[The requirement description.]

## 3.4 Performance
[The system's performance characteristics should be outlined in this section.]

- Response time for a transaction (average, maximum).
- Throughput - transactions per second.
- Capacity.
- Degradation modes.
- Resource utilization.

### 3.4.1 Performance Requirement One
[The requirement description goes here.]

## 3.5 Supportability
[This section indicates any requirements that will enhance the supportability or maintainability of the system.]

### 3.5.1 Supportability Requirement One
[The requirement description goes here.]

## 3.6 Design Constraints
[This section should indicate any design constraints on the system being built.]

### 3.6.1 Design Constraint One
[The requirement description goes here.]

## 3.7 Online User Documentation and Help System Requirements
[Describes the requirements, if any, for on-line user documentation, help systems, help about notices, etc.]

## 3.8 Purchased Components
[This section describes any purchased components to be used with the system, licensing or usage restrictions, and compatibility standards.]

## 3.9 Interfaces
[This section defines the interfaces that must be supported by the application.]

### 3.9.1 User Interfaces
[Describe the user interfaces that are to be implemented by the software.]

### 3.9.2 Hardware Interfaces
[This section defines any hardware interfaces.]

### 3.9.3 Software Interfaces
[This section describes software interfaces to other components of the system.]

### 3.9.4 Communications Interfaces
[Describe any communications interfaces.]

## 3.10 Licensing Requirements
[Defines any licensing enforcement requirements or other usage restriction requirements that are to be exhibited by the software.]

## 3.11 Legal, Copyright, and Other Notices
[This section describes any necessary legal disclaimers, warranties, copyright notices, etc.]

## 3.12 Applicable Standards
[This section describes by reference any applicable standards and specific sections which apply to the system.]
