## Introduction

Hello, we are a Team of five students. In the oncoming 9 month we want to develope an application called 'GluGuide'. To find out more about our project, please read our [SRS](SRS.md) or our [SAD](SAD.md). We will upload a blogpost on our [Blog](https://gdewomenhealth.wordpress.com/) every week to update you on our progress.
We would be so happy if you follow us on our journey.

## Product vision

If the blood sugar exceeds certain levels during pregnancy, experts speak of gestational diabetes. It is diagnosed in around 5 out of 100 women.

Our mission is to develop GluGuide into a helpful resource for women managing gestational diabetes. Each feature, from tracking to reminders, is crafted with care to make life a little easier.

Documenting our development process helps us stay focused on what truly matters—creating a supportive, reliable app for our users. Along the way, we’re constantly learning and evolving to ensure GluGuide becomes the best it can be.
